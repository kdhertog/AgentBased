%% step1c_updateProperties.m description
% This file contains code to update the relevant properties of the two
% flights that have accepted a formation.

% Make sure that the following variables are assigned to those belonging to
% the combination of the manager/auctioneer agent (acNr1) and the winning
% contractor/bidding agent (acNr2): acNr2, fuelSavingsOffer,
% divisionFutureSavings. Also: Xjoining, Yjoining, Xsplitting, Ysplitting,
% VsegmentAJ_acNr1, VsegmentBJ_acNr2, timeAdded_acNr1, timeAdded_acNr2,
% potentialFuelSavings. These variables follow from
% step1b_routingSynchronizationFuelSavings.m and differ for every
% combination of acNr1 and acNr2.

% One way of doing this is storing them as part of the bid, and then
% defining them again when the manager awards the contract in the CNP/the
% winning bid is selected in the auctions.
