%% step1a_doNegotiation_CNP.m description
% Add your CNP agent models and edit this file to create your CNP. 

% This file uses the matrix generated in determineCommunicationCandidates.m
% (in step1_performCommunication.m) that contains every communication
% candidate for each flight. The function
% determineRoutingAndSynchronization.m then determines if formation is
% possible for a pair of flights, the optimal joining- and splitting point,
% and what their respective speeds should be towards the joining point to
% arrive at the same time. The function calculateFuelSavings.m then
% determines how much cumulative fuel is saved when accepting this
% formation flight. If accepted, the properties in flightsData (the matrix
% that contains all information of each flight) for both flights are
% updated in step1c_updateProperties.m.

% Make sure that the following variables are assigned to those belonging to
% the combination of the manager/auctioneer agent (acNr1) and the winning
% contractor/bidding agent (acNr2): acNr2, fuelSavingsOffer,
% divisionFutureSavings. Also: Xjoining, Yjoining, Xsplitting, Ysplitting,
% VsegmentAJ_acNr1, VsegmentBJ_acNr2, timeAdded_acNr1, timeAdded_acNr2,
% potentialFuelSavings. These variables follow from
% step1b_routingSynchronizationFuelSavings.m and differ for every
% combination of acNr1 and acNr2.

% One way of doing this is storing them as part of the bid, and then
% defining them again when the manager awards the contract in the CNP/the
% winning bid is selected in the auctions.

% It contains two files: step1b_routingSynchronizationFuelSavings.m
% (determineRoutingAndSynchronization.m, calculateFuelSavings.m) and
% step1c_updateProperties.m.
