%% calculateResults.m description
% This function determines the realized fuel savings, the extra flight time
% due to formation flying, and the extra distance flown due to formation
% flying. It does this by first calculating the fuel consumption, flight
% distance, and flight time, if only solo flights were flown. Next, it
% calculates the actual fuel consumption, flight distance, and flight time,
% and compares the two.

% inputs: 
% nAircraft (number of real aircraft),
% flightsDataRecordings (flight data recorder that contains the flightsData
% at every time t),
% Wfinal (Zero Fuel Weight (ZFW) + Maximum Payload Weight of every aircraft
% after a complete solo flight [kg]),
% Vmax (Vmax [m/s]),
% fuelSavingsTotal (total fuel savings [kg]).

% outputs: 
% fuelSavingsTotalPct (percentual fuel savings, comparing the actual fuel
% use to the total fuel use if of only solo flights were flown),
% fuelSavingsAlliancePct (percentage of the total fuel savings that went to
% the alliance),
% fuelSavingsNonAlliancePct (percentage of the total fuel savings that went
% to the non-alliance flights),
% extraDistancePct (percentual change in total distance, comparing the
% actual total distance to the total distance if only solo flights were
% flown),
% extraFlightTimePct (percentual change in total flight, comparing the
% actual flight time to the total flight time of only solo flights were
% flown).
