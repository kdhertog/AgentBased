%% determineCommunicationCandidates.m description
% This function determines the different flights with which each flight is
% able to communicate. Each flight has its communication circle, if two
% intersect, these two flights are able to communicate. 

% Randomize the starting flight ID to ensure that not at every time step
% flights with lower flight IDs benefit from having first pick in
% determining whether to act as manager in the CNP, or auctioneer in the
% auctions.

% inputs: 
% flightsData (matrix that contains all properties on each flight), 
% communicationRange (maximum communication distance BETWEEN two aircraft).

% output: communicationCandidates (the first column of each row indicates a
% flight's ID, column two and on indicate the flight ID's of those
% flights the flight in the first column can communicate with).
