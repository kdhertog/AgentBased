%% generateFlights.m description
% This function generates the initial properties for each real flight. You
% are free to add additional properties and can predefine them in this
% function. This function also creates the random flight schedules. In
% addition, this function generates the dummy flights that will represent
% two flights in formation and act as their formation leader.

% inputs: 
% nAircraft (number of real aircraft),
% Vmax (Vmax [m/s]),
% MFuelSolo (M-value solo/leader aircraft at Vmax),
% Wfinal (Zero Fuel Weight (ZFW) + Maximum Payload Weight of every aircraft
% after a complete solo flight [kg]),
% muOriginX (means and standard deviations of x- and y-coordinates for the
% creation of normally distributed random origin and destination airports),
% stddevOriginX,
% muOriginY,
% stddevOriginY,
% muDestX,
% stddevDestX,
% muDestY,
% stddevDestY,
% flightsPerAirportAmericas (average flights per airport, used to determine
% the number of airports in the random flight schedule),
% flightsPerAirportEuro,
% percentageAlliance (percentage of flights that are part of the alliance),
% minInitialDelay (minimum initial delay [min.]),
% maxInitialDelay (maximum initial delay [min.]).

% outputs: 
% flightsInitialData (contains the initial data of each real flight and
% 2*nAircraft predefined dummy flights)

% When two engaged flights reach their joining point, a dummy flight is
% generated that represents the two flights in the simulation, and leads
% them. The dummy flight will handle the communication with other flights
% to commit to a new formation. Note that dummy flights can become
% followers of yet another dummy flight. Through this process, formations
% can grow to essentially any size. For more information on dummy flights,
% see Ch. 6.4 of Verhagen's thesis.

% flightsInitialData rows have 28 columns. Each row indicates the following
% properties for a (dummy) flight:
% 1: Flight ID (starting from 1 to nAircraft for real flights, then from
% nAircraft+1 for dummy flights)
% 2: Communication status (0: engaged and not available for comm., 1:
% available for comm.)
% 3: X-coordinate of origin
% 4: Y-coordinate of origin
% 5: X-coordinate of destination
% 6: Y-coordinate of destination
% 7: Current speed [m/s]
% 8: Current heading [dy/dx]
% 9: X-coordinate of joining point of formation
% 10: Y-coordinate of joining point of formation
% 11: X-coordinate of splitting point of formation
% 12: Y-coordinate of splitting point of formation
% 13: Current M-value. During flight, the fuel consumption of an aircraft
% is governed by this M-value.
% 14: X-coordinate of current location
% 15: Y-coordinate of current location
% 16: Flight status (0: not flying, 1: is flying)
% 17: Formation status (0: not in formation, 1: in formation)
% 18: Arrival status (0: not arrived, 1: has arrived)
% 19: Formation size/weight factor of solo aircraft, or the formation which
% a dummy flight represents. Used for geometric routing.
% 20: Flight ID of the flight to which it is engaged. Engaged refers to
% two flights having committed to a formation flight strategy, that have
% not reached each other yet (0: if not engaged to any flight).
% 21: In-formation status (0: follower, 1: solo, 2: formation leader
% (always a dummy flight)). 
% 22: Flight ID of the flight that this flight is following. (0: if not
% following any flight).
% 23: Starting weight of the flight [kg].
% 24: Departure time of the flight [min. after 17:00].
% 25: Alliance member (0: dummy flight, 1: non-alliance, 2: alliance).
% 26: Max. delay that can be accepted for future formations [min.]. This
% property is updated after a formation partner is found. For dummy flights
% it is equal to the minimum max. delay of the two flights the dummy flight
% represents.
% 27: This holds how much fuel savings the flight received from its latest
% formation [kg]. The default code distributes the fuel savings between the
% flights of the formation based on property 19 (weight factor).
% 28: Division of future fuel savings [%]. Indicates how fuel savings from
% future formations will be distributed between the two flights of the
% current formation. The default code distributes the future fuel savings
% between the flights of the formation based on property 19 (weight
% factor).

% special cases: 
% * More dummy flights may be required to cover aircraft that switch
% formation when one breaks up and a new one forms.
% * flightsInitialData may not change size during the simulation.
% * Dummy flight rows may not be moved/used until they are needed.
